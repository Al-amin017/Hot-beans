        <h2>Sarah Thompson: Web Developer Trainee</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Sarah, a Web Development Trainee at Hot Beans, and my journey into the world of web development started with a fascination for how technology shapes user experiences. With a background in Computer Science, I’ve developed a strong foundation in front-end development, particularly with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. As part of my current training, I’m involved in building a fully functional e-commerce website, where I contribute to creating dynamic, responsive UI components and integrating them with back-end services. I’m also working closely with Node.js and Express to implement the back-end logic and create RESTful APIs that manage product data and user interactions. I thrive in collaborative environments and regularly participate in code reviews, ensuring that the team follows industry best practices. My goal is to evolve into a well-rounded full-stack developer who is capable of designing, developing, and deploying scalable web applications from start to finish. I’m particularly focused on improving my knowledge of back-end technologies and understanding how to optimize performance at every stage of development.

        <h2>David, a Front-End Developer Trainee</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m David, a Front-End Developer Trainee at Hot Beans, where I focus on crafting interactive and visually appealing web applications. After completing a degree in Web Design, I transitioned into front-end development, where I’ve become passionate about JavaScript, Vue.js, and building responsive web interfaces. I am currently working on a data-driven sales dashboard, which requires me to develop dynamic components using Vue.js while ensuring the application is intuitive and performs well across all devices. I’ve also started using TypeScript in this project to improve code maintainability, reduce bugs, and make the development process more efficient. My background in design helps me approach development with a user-centric mindset, ensuring that the end product is not only functional but also visually engaging. I have strong expertise in HTML5 and CSS3 and am constantly refining my skills in responsive design using Flexbox and CSS Grid. My ultimate goal is to become a more proficient front-end developer by mastering modern frameworks and tools and deepening my understanding of UX/UI principles to create web experiences that delight users.

        <h2>Emma, a Back-End Developer Trainee</h2>
        <p>I’m Emma, a Back-End Developer Trainee at Hot Beans, where I focus on server-side development using Python and Django. I joined Hot Beans to transition from my initial studies in software engineering into real-world web development, specifically back-end technologies. I’m currently working on building the back-end infrastructure for a customer support platform, where my main responsibilities involve designing and developing RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework and integrating them with a PostgreSQL database. This has given me an in-depth understanding of how to structure data, manage server-side logic, and implement authentication and security protocols. Additionally, I’ve had the chance to refine my skills in query optimization and database management, ensuring that the back-end is efficient and scalable. As part of my training, I’m collaborating with front-end developers to ensure seamless data flow between the client and server. In the future, I want to expand my knowledge of cloud technologies and microservices architecture, as I believe they will play a key role in developing scalable and resilient applications.
